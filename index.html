<h1>LukeTube Blogs</h1><h2>Its beta time!</h2><div><p>The public beta is here, so please tell me what you guys think in the discord server! You people also probably 
want an explanation for why all the accounts arent migrated yet or why I have to migrate them in the first place, and thats because it takes about 10 minutes per account, and thats
not accounting for other things that could go wrong during the process, or the amount of videos on the channel. Long story short takes too long to do. Anyways, cya later!
<h2>Hi guys!</h2><div><p>Welcome to LukeTube, the not so good (currently) alternative to YouTube! I know the strike is over, 
but I'm sure that after the strike people most likely don't want to use YouTube as much. Anyways you can sign up for an account on the discord OR you can email me,
like it says at the bottom of the page. Happy LukeTubing! -Luke, Founder of LukeTube</p></div>
