# LukeTube Beta

YouTube "Alternative" & Video upload website for me & my friends.

Because its hosted through GitHub Pages, videos are in 480p (If higher resolution it is even harder to deal with the 100mb file limit).

To upload a video, make a channel, or have a channel edited, you need to contact me because idk how to make this stuff automatic.

If im doing this right, you are currently viewing the MAIN branch. This branch contains the files that will be hosted on the website.
