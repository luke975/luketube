YouTube "Alternative" & Video upload website for me & my friends.

Because its hosted through GitHub Pages, videos are in 480p (If higher resolution it is even harder to compensate to the 100mb file limit).

Video uploads, channel edits, and other stuff go through me , as idk how to make it automatic.
